#**TEMPLATE SEARCHES**

*What is a template search?*

A template search is a pre-defined
query that we have created for you. A 
template search allows you to search 
the database without having to 
construct your own query or understand
the underlying data structure, A 
library of template searches covering 
the full range of data is available.

A template search consists of a
simple form with one or more options
for you to enter or select. Default values
are always provided so you can 
immediately run them and see if they 
return the data you are after.

Each template has a short name and
a longer description. We provide a
short name so you can quickly scan
the available searches and find the
one that you need. The longer 
description will provide you with more
details and any limitations to the 
values you can enter.

**To access the template library** click 
on the templates tab in the main 
menu bar as shown in image below.
