# TEMPLATE SEARCHES

*What is a template search?*

A template search is a pre-defined
query that we have created for you. A 
template search allows you to search 
the database without having to 
construct your own query or understand
the underlying data structure, A 
library of template searches covering 
the full range of data is available.

A template search consists of a
simple form with one or more options
for you to enter or select. Default values
are always provided so you can 
immediately run them and see if they 
return the data you are after.

Each template has a short name and
a longer description. We provide a
short name so you can quickly scan
the available searches and find the
one that you need. The longer 
description will provide you with more
details and any limitations to the 
values you can enter.

**To access the template library** click 
on the templates tab in the main 
menu bar as shown in image below.

# FINDING THE TEMPLATE THAT YOU WANT

The list of template searches is long.
To help you find the search that you 
want you can filter the list using either
keywords or data categories:

# CAN'T FIND WHAT YOU WANT-PLEASE ASK

If you can't fidn a template search
that you want or if there is one 
available but it doesn't quite return
everything you are after please *contact us*.
Template searches can be created or modified and made available 
to you immediately, providing the
data is available in the database. Use 
the *contact us* form found on every 
InterMine page or email us at support@flymine.org 

# RUNNING A TEMPLATE SEARCH

A template search provides you with
a form, with one or more variables to
set. Some will require you to enter a value, while others will provide drop
down lists for you to select from.
Some templates provide optional constraints. These constraints can be 
turned on or off as required. Once you
are happy with your options, simply 
click **show results** to run the search.

# HOW DO I RUN A TEMPLATE SEARCH WITH ONE OF MY LISTS OR A PUBLIC LIST?

First, *Remember to log-in* so that your
own lists can be viewed. Every template
can  be run on relevant **lists** of 
objects- if you have lists of the correct
type (e.g a list of genes) or if
there is a suitable public list, you will 
be able to select the one you require
from a drop-down list. You need to
select the checkbox to access this.

Your template will return a results
tables. As well as displaying your
results, the results tables are a 
powerful analysis tool as well. See
the **Results Tables** for more details 
and for information on how to save or
