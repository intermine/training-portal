## We develop with GitHub
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

InterMine Training Portal repository: https://github.com/intermine/training-portal

If you are new to GitHub,
<a href="https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#how-to-submit-a-contribution">Open Source Guides</a>
will help you quick start.

## All code changes happen through pull requests


In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html">GitHub Flow</a>. We actively welcome your pull requests:
<br/>
<br/>

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!


## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same
<a href="http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/" style="color:blue;">MIT License</a> that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.


## Report bugs using Github's issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by <a href="https://github.com/intermine/training-portal/issues/new">opening a new issue</a>

## Submit a fix

If you fix a bug, submit by <a href="https://github.com/intermine/training-portal/issues/new">pull request</a>


## Propose new features
We welcome new features about the code, videos, layout, and others!

## Write more docs
If you find that some documentations are unclear, incomplete, or wrong, you can add new contents!

## Become a maintainer
Welcome! We’re excited to have you join the community. InterMine integrates biological data, but you don’t have to be a biologist to contribute to InterMine. Some of our entry-level issues only require knowledge of the relevant programming language, but others may require more in-depth understanding.
