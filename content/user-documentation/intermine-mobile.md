# InterMine Mobile

## InterMine Android and iOS Apps

InterMine smartphone applications allow you to carry the power of multiple InterMines in your pocket. They include a cross-InterMine search tool, allowing you to browse lists, templates, and create a selection of "**favourites**" - _perhaps a set of publications to review or a collection of interesting genes_.  Use the links below to download our app.
